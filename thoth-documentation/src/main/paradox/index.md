Thoth is a library that provides a way to implement event-sourcing in Java applications.

## Event sourcing

Rather than maintaining an up-to-date application state, event sourcing focuses on what happened by storing events.

This approach provides by-design audit log for the application.

It is also very well suited for event-driven architectures : events can be published as is.

It plays well with CQRS : building and maintaining read projections is done by consuming events.

## Thoth

Thoth guaranties that:

* Events will be written in the database before being published in Kafka (to prevent failure)
* Publication in Kafka will be reattempted until it succeeds

It provides capabilities of defining two types of projections :

* “Real time” projections, that are updated in the same transaction as the events
* “Eventually consistent” projections, updated asynchronously by consuming Kafka

## Documentation

This documentation focuses on implementing event-sourcing on a simple use case : a banking application.
